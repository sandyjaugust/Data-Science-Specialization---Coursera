In this project, I used the raw data in rprog_data_ProgAssignment3-data.zip to create 4 R files:
1. CreateHist.R: Builds a histogram of the 30-day mortality rates for heart attacks by hospital.
2. best.R: Returns the hospital in a specified state with the lowest mortality rate for a particular condition.
3. rankHospital.R: Returns a character vector with the name of the hospital that has the ranking specified by the num argument. 
4. rankAll.R: Returns a 2-column data frame containing the hospital in every state that has the ranking specified by the num argument.
