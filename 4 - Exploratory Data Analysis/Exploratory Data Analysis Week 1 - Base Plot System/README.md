**Data used for this project:** Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

**Date:** Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
**Time:** time in format hh:mm:ss
**Global_active_power:** household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
**Global_reactive_power:** household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
**Voltage:** minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
**Global_intensity:** household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
**Sub_metering_1:** energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
**Sub_metering_2:** energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
**Sub_metering_3:** energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

Using this data set, I created 4 R files to recreate 4 plots provided to me by my instructors on Coursera. The 4 completed plots are included in this folder in addition to the R code used to generate them.
